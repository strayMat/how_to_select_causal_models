People that already did some works on causal model selection:

- [Nigam Shah](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n63DmP8AAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao), a bit too high level but I he matches well the journal and
  targeted reader. 
- [Alejandro Schuler](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YbsggPYAAAAJ&hl=fr&oi=ao), good target, ML and healthcare vibes + causal works
- Jennifer Hill, the author of BART, good reader but not enough healthcare.
