Dear Editor,

Please find our submission on causal model selection for predictive models in medicine for consideration in "GigaScience", as a research article. This article addresses a crucial and often overlooked aspect of the application of machine learning models for medical decision-making: for a given potential intervention, the model should be evaluated in how well it captures the treatment effect. As opposed to classic evaluation solely focused on predictive accuracy, machine learning for decision making should use different selection metrics borrowing tools from causal inference. 

The manuscript is written in a didactic way, provides theoretical framing of the problem and a thorough empirical evaluation which leads to clear recommendations for causal evaluation of predictive models.

We confirm that this work is original and has not been previously published or under consideration for publication elsewhere. 

Thank you for considering this submission. We are confident that the article will make a significant contribution to the field and spark better evaluation in the context of predictive models for biomedical sciences.

Yours sincerely,

Matthieu Doutreligne and GaÃ«l Varoquaux
